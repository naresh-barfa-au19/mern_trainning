        The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the
        request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on. In this
        documentation and by convention, the object is always referred to as req
        (and the HTTP response is res) but its actual name is determined by the
        parameters to the callback function in which youâ€™re working. For
        example:
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
